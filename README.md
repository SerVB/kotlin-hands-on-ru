# Kotlin Hands-On in Russian
Welcome! This is a set of unofficial Russian translations of [Kotlin Hands-On](https://play.kotlinlang.org/hands-on) tutorials.

## List
* [Building Web Applications with React and Kotlin JS](hands-on/Building%20Web%20Applications%20with%20React%20and%20Kotlin%20JS.md).

## Conventions
Let's agree on some points to make these translations consistent.

### Translation precision
There is no aim to make it 100% precise. There can be comments and minor edits/additions by the translator. Also, restructuring can be performed to make the translated text sound better and more logical.

### Formatting
* Images/listings: when the line ends with a colon, the next line should contain the image/listing right away; when the line ends with a dot, the next line should be empty and only the second line should contain the image/listing.
* There should be no empty lines after a header (`#`), but there should be an empty line between a paragraph and a header.
* Filenames, paths, names of projects should be marked as `code`.
* Code pieces inside text should be marked as `code`, this also applies to names of dependencies and versions.
* Shortcuts should be marked as `code`, the separator of keys should be `+`.
* Names of UI elements should be marked **bold**.
* Names of technologies and features should be plain, unless there is emphasis, for the latter case they should be **bold**. Otherwise, new terms and features should be *italic*.
* Quotes (`>`) are used to emphasise the whole paragraphs.
